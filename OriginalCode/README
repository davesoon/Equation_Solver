This program is designed to solve basic equtions.  these equations have one variable, and the program
will read the input and solve for x


Here are the rules for the program so far:  

    This program solves for one varible, x (use no other letter in place of x) and it is designed to
    solve for x when it is used in an equation, such as x+2+2x^2+4=50+x+2(x+4). You can copy and past 
    that equation into the code and it will produce an answer.  

    x up to the 4th power can be solved (x^4) and x, x^2, x^3 can all be inputed and multiplied against 
    each other, assuming that the x^power does not excede 4.
    
    parenthesis can be used, but only sparingly.  Coefficeients work, such as in the following problem  
    2(x+2), or 2x^2(x+1).    but, parenthesis multiplication does not work yet: (x+2)(2x+2) 
    
    Addition works, multiplication works, but Division does not work on this program!  I have yet to find
    a method that allows me to easy divide.  Subtraction is easy to do as it is simply addition of a 
    negative, and this can be easily accounted for.  But division is the multiplication of a reciprical,
    and I have yet to find an easy way to impliment it.  
    
    Any length of problem can be inputed, and if you leave out the '=' (it is supposed to solve an 
    equation) it will add "=0" to the end of your equation if it is left off.  
    
    THERE WILL BE MANY ERRORS depending on the syntax of how the equation is input and the opperations 
    within the equation.  
    

The program is still in its infancy!  There will be many errors.  and if you try to understand the code 
you will find a lack of comments... its a bad habbit of mine, but I can explain the code to you, and i 
have tried to add more comments.   

There will be many many errors.
